## getting started
The design spaces panel provides a tabbed interface that looks by default like this:

from the top:

The **local menu** contains these items:

* New
* Duplicate
* -- <separator> --
* Delete…

**notes**:

* Duplicate not only duplicates the current design space tab, it also duplicates its instances in the instances list;
* Delete ot only removes the current design space tab, it also removes its instances from the instances list.

The **tabs** can be renamed by double clicking on their label, and resorted. Always at the right (for L–to–R locales) there is a ‘New tab’ tab. The tabs do not have close boxes ([X]), because it a way to heavy action (lose all instances that live on this tab) to be causally offered. Tabs will need an overflow mechanism for when there are too many to show at once. We expect quite a few tabs because they are for serious projects a way to break down complexity for users.

The space is not configured, so its background is still ‘chrome’ and it prompts a **choice of space**:

Exploration is not compatible with Control. Exploration is a flat-earth, limited view of metapolation reality, Control can set and show any possible combination. **So a choice must be made**, by clicking either on the big link or the illustration. **shortcut**: drop one or more master (sequences) on the big link or illustration to make the choice _and_ initialise the space with the dropped items.

Once the choice is made the tab transitions (suggestion: dissolve) to the empty state for that type:

We see the background is now of the content type and that an icon representing the type of design space has been inserted in the tab. This helps identifying multiple tabs:
