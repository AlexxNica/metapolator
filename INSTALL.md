# Install Metapolator for Developers

Use Vagrant to install metapolator:

```
vagrant init metapolator/bleeding-edge
vagrant up
```

You can then `vagrant ssh` into the box, or `vagrant ssh -- COMMAND ARG...` to run a command on it.

(FIXME: add instructions for running and accessing red pill and other services.)
