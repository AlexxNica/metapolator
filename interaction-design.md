## Product Vision

_Our ['Product Vision'](http://www.mmiworks.net/wedo/product.html) defines and guides Metapolator's development, and was written by Peter Sikking in April 2014 Following a discussion with the developers ([video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJH6fNCv1Fs))_

Metapolator is an open web tool for making many fonts. It supports working in a font design space, instead of one glyph, one face, at a time.

With Metapolator, ‘pro’ font designers are able to create and edit fonts and font families much faster, with inherent consistency. They gain unique exploration possibilities and the tools to quickly adapt typefaces to different media and domains of use.

With Metapolator, typographers gain the possibility to change existing fonts—or even create new ones—to their needs.

Metapolator is extendible through plugins and custom specimens. It contains all the tools and fine control that designers need to finish a font.

## [user scenarios](https://github.com/metapolator/metapolator/wiki/user-scenarios)
User scenarios show the essential use, in logical, worthwhile and valuable steps from users’ point of view. We have [7 scenarios](https://github.com/metapolator/metapolator/wiki/user-scenarios):
* Easy beginnings: make subtle changes to an existing font to adapt it to domain of use.
* Typographer applies radical graphical treatments to an existing font for a design.
* Font designer creates a new font through exploration of two compatible masters.
* Create a font from sketch.
* The grind: flesh out 3+ masters to a family/multiverse.
* Extend: add script (i.e. a writing system) support.
* Extend: add a custom algorithm.
