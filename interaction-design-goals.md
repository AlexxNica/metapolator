1. design in context; type design is quite a bit about how it all fits together, allow to design while it can be seen together.
* liberate the creation of masters; it should be easy-peasy to create another one, not the weeks+ of work that it is now. the interaction should express—and deliver—how casual one can deal with masters.
* make the master the natural level to work with parameters.
* 50% of metapolator is about making type design and adaptation an order of magnitude faster than before. the other 50% is about unlocking creativity, to go in-between/outside the beaten paths. 
* the design space is both for working precisely; and for going on an exploration trip with unknown outcome.
* design for working easily with (much) more than four masters.
* preserve and build out from the stroke of genius—aka the smashing value—of metapolator: no matter how tricksy things get with parameters within a master, once in design space this all disappears; a master is a black box; a good font™ (the linking mechanism).
* the pain of working glyph-by-glyph is still in the work with the skeletons; address it.
* parameters up and down the hierarchy combine and override. make it work for users; it must be clear in a second why something is not changing as expected.
* if a parameter can be shown as a handle near a glyph, do it.
* speaking of handles: no itty-bitty, teeny-weeny, hard-to-use, 80s handles.
* manage the black/outlines duality in a natural way.
* no administrative overhead for users (e.g. having to name stuff, all the time).
