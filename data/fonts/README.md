The verbatim directory contains plain clones of font data that can be
used in examples. Works derived from the fonts in the verbatim
directory will be placed into other directories depending on purpose.
For example, a subset of the glyphs of Merriweather-Regular.otf might
be saved into subsets/Merriweather-Regular-PAN.ufo to allow quicker
tinkering using only the PAN glyphs or some other subset.
