<br/>_nicolas pauly (r) and peter sikking working on the wall-of-concept._

This is a visual report, with notes, of the 2-day Metapolator product workshop that took place on 9+10 July, 2014 at the Type Designers Studio, Zürich, Switzerland. Involved where Simon Egli and peter sikking, with contributions by nicolas pauly, Wei Huang (remote) and Eben Sorkin (via [this](https://plus.google.com/106288796449831139244/posts/W874iEgTcxM)).

Now where to start, there is so much we covered in these two days…

## of master sequences and sausages
First thing we worked on was that masters in a design space are more often than not related to each other. They can form sequences (think thin–medium–bold, but also a thin-italic-narrow-sans to heavy-wide-slab sequence).

Out of 3-or-more masters a sequence can be auto-detected (all significant changes of parameters line up for them) and any 2-or-more can be made a sequence by users. Master sequences are shown as lines in design space.

**notes** (see numbers in image above):

1. if there are two sequences, they either cross at some point (not necessarily at some master) or not;
* some crossing (and not) of 3 sequences;
* a red ‘string of instances’ (4 of them) is spanned over a 3-sequences design space
* some crossing (and not) of 4 sequences;
* force fields around some sequences (aka sausages) and single masters make up a design space.
