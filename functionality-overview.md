Functionality is the most dry, to-the-point—call it boring—description of what a piece of software does; i.e. its features. It is limited to a description of _what_ it does and leaves out _how_ these are invoked and accomplished; i.e. the user interaction is not part of the functionality.

The functionality overview serves as a checklist for the design process—and the project—to know ’what is in the box’ and answers ‘did we forget anything?’

Below we will go top-down through the Metapolator structure and sum up the functionality that shall be included. Some things will be marked with ‘(later)’, meaning it is not scheduled for the october 2014 release.

## working on a project

project: New, either Save functionality or an auto-persistence model (includes Delete then)

github integration: actions TBD (keep it simple for designers, please)

a project contains:
* masters
* design spaces
* instances

## utility
aka the garbage can department, everything that does not fit above is gathered here.
