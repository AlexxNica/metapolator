# Metapolator FAQ

#### What is Metapolator?

_Our [Product Vision](https://github.com/metapolator/metapolator/wiki/interaction-design#product-vision)
 defines and guides the project's development. It was written by Peter Sikking (Interaction Architect) in April 2014 after a detailed discussion with the developers._

Metapolator is an open web tool for making many fonts. It supports working in a font design space, instead of one glyph, one face, at a time.

With Metapolator, ‘pro’ font designers are able to create and edit fonts and font families much faster, with inherent consistency. They gain unique exploration possibilities and the tools to quickly adapt typefaces to different media and domains of use.

With Metapolator, typographers gain the possibility to change existing fonts—or even create new ones—to their needs.

Metapolator is extendible through plugins and custom specimens. It contains all the tools and fine control that designers need to finish a font.
