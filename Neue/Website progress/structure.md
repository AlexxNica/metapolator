# Metapolator website hierarchy

#### Introduction

Metapolator can turn any existing outline font into a parameterised font system.

Metapolator is intended for type designers to design large font families faster, and for typographically sensitive graphic designers to adjust their fonts for their exact needs. For example, expanding a single style design into a family of weights and widths, or fine-tuning the weight and width of a font for your exact needs.

Metapolator first provides a typical 'super' interpolation system that works with unlimited numbers of masters and axes, and will load and save normal UFO fonts.

It will go further, into 'metapolation': leveraging parameterization to create new masters. This will work best when glyphs are drawn as separate, overlapping shapes with pairs of points along each edge. This style of digital drawing is commonly practiced, as it helps when drawing shapes resembling strokes of pens.

The original drawn outline can be reconstructed from an inferred central skeleton and Hobby splines. This reconstruction process is flexible, working similarly to the 'nudge' tools of other font editors.

Why the project?

key future dates

- Metapolator first provides a typical 'super' interpolation system that works with unlimited numbers of masters and axes, and will load and save normal UFO fonts.

- web-based parametric font editor, providing a GUI for designing with UFO fonts and Metafont technologies. 

#### Key Concepts

1. Skeleton

fig. UFO font -> Skeleton 

fig. pen compass

2. METAFONT Contours

fig. nicely stretched letter shapes

3. Tagged Contours (shifting)

fig. Tagged Outline -> Design Spaces -> Metapolation

2. Parameters from Metafont (tools, like tension, shifing, bla)

3. Metapolation `fig. design spaces from peter`

#### Examples of Metapolated Type Designs

It can work with any prepared font just like:

* `Sean : Latin and Devanagari`
* `Breite : Latin and Cyrillic`
* `Alice : Latin and Chinese`

The font we are working on and the output of those (upcomming..)

1 Redpill progress proof of concept `fig. screenshot red pill`

	Maybe we can show a bit of code in use, it's always nice to see code.

2 explore a lot of different design ideas (contrast width etc) from one master `fig.universe `

3 totaly new User interface whit design spaces `fig. new ui`
