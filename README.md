======================

This repository contains the files needed to run metapolator in a Docker container.

Running metapolator with Docker is easy:

```
$ sudo docker pull metapolator/metapolator
$ sudo docker run -p 8080:8080 -t metapolator/metapolator
# open in browser http://localhost
```

There is an issue with VirtualBox and docker (https://github.com/metapolator/metapolator/issues/100#issuecomment-41560966). To solve it be sure you have executed this command

```
VBoxManage controlvm boot2docker-vm natpf1 "metapolator,tcp,127.0.0.1,8080,,8080"
```
