This a developer documentation wiki. It can only be edited by Metapolator team members, but joining our team is easy - just ask in the [Metapolator G+ Community](https://plus.google.com/communities/110027004108709154749)

Pro Tip: This wiki can eat your work if you click submit after someone else also edited this page and already clicked submit before you! So select all and copy your version first, before clicking submit.
