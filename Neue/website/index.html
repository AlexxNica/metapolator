  <p>Metapolator is intended for type designers to design large font families faster, and for typographically sensitive graphic designers to adjust their libre fonts for their exact needs.</p>

  <p>Metapolator is intended for type designers to design large font families faster, and for typographically sensitive graphic designers to adjust their libre fonts for their exact needs. For example, <u6>expanding a single style design</u6> into a family of weights and widths, or fine-tuning the weight and width of a font for your exact needs.Metapolator first provides a typical 'super' interpolation system that works with unlimited numbers of masters and axes, and will load and save normal UFO fonts.

  <p>It will go further, into 'metapolation': <u5>leveraging parameterization to create new masters</u5>. This will work best when glyphs are drawn as separate, overlapping shapes with pairs of points along each edge. This style of <u6>digital drawing</u6> is commonly practiced, as it helps when drawing shapes resembling strokes of pens.
