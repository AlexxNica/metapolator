## overall structure

Let’s develop an overall structure for the user interaction; a global plan for where everything in Metapolator ‘lives’. All the functionality we have to pack, even for v1.0, does not fit on one screen; different departments need to be created. But we also want to create a sense of continuity for users, not just a collection of screens and panels.

We can observe the following:

* the **masters** form the connection between the world of skeletons & parameters, and the design spaces.
* the **instances** form the connection between the design spaces and real font (families).
* the two statements above have in common the **design spaces**, they connect masters to instances.

With these three connecting elements, we can chain four departments together, their working titles are:

1. Parameters
* Design Spaces
* Metapolation
* Fonts
